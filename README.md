# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction App

## 🚀 Overview
The **Student Performance Prediction App** is an end-to-end machine learning project designed to predict students' academic performance based on key factors such as study hours, attendance, previous scores, and other academic indicators. 

This project follows a structured ML pipeline, covering:
- **Data Ingestion**: Loading and preparing raw data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Using **CatBoost** to achieve an **87% accuracy**.
- **Prediction & Deployment**: Serving predictions through a **Flask web interface**.

With an interactive web UI, users can input student details and receive performance predictions in real time.

## 📊 Model & Data Pipeline
### 🔹 **Data Ingestion (Data_ingestion.py)**
- Reads `data.csv`
- Splits into train (`train.csv`) and test (`test.csv`)

### 🔹 **Data Transformation (Data_transformation.py)**
- Handles missing values, feature scaling, and encoding
- Saves preprocessor (`preprocessor.pkl`)

### 🔹 **Model Training (Model_trainer.py)**
- Uses **CatBoost** for training
- Saves the best model (`best_model.pkl`)

### 🔹 **Prediction (Predict_pipeline.py)**
- Loads trained model & preprocessor
- Takes user input and predicts student performance

## 📌 Web Interface
🖥 **Homepage (home.html):** Input student data for prediction  
📊 **Results Page (index.html):** Displays predicted performance  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 **Add support for multiple ML models** (XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)  
🔹 **Improve feature engineering** to enhance prediction accuracy.  
🔹 **Deploy the app as a Dockerized microservice** for scalability.  
🔹 **Enhance the web interface** using React or Streamlit for better UX.
